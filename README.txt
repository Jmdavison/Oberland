------------------------

You are a typical suburban 90's kid who has turned to the iconic figures of
your childhood to help cope with the pressures of adult life in the 21st century.

Go out into the night, gather items and recruit your friends in order to help
defend your home from the endless waves of solicitors, debt collectors,
annoying colleagues, and more that come during the day.

The game fuses two traditional game genres into one, Survival adventure and Tower Defense.

The graphics are reminiscent to early 90's portable games such as pokemon, legend of zelda
fire emblem, etc.

click around the map to smove your character, collect the various objects needed to persuade the characters from your past to join your team, and defend
you from the evils that come during the day
