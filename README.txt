You are a typical suburban 90's kid who has turned to the iconic figures of
your childhood to help cope with the pressures of adult life in the 21st century.

Go out into the night, gather items and see if you can unlock all of the characters!

*This game is conceptually unfinished, but has satisfied the requirements for the class 
project. I may continue development at some point. But as of now the game stands as an 
example of my first from scratch HTML5 Canvas game, and has served it's purpose for me 
educationally.*

Thanks guys,

Jake.
