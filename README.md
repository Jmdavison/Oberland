##This project was made for educational purposes only.

### Go out into the night, gather items and see if you can unlock all of the characters!

The game was created using no external libraries, and was based on the tutorial by MDN on scrolling tilemaps found [Here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/Tilemaps/Square_tilemaps_implementation:_Scrolling_maps)

The map, items, characters, and quest objectives are all created by a process of random generation.

All image and sprite sources can be found in the original images used in the images folder

*This game is conceptually unfinished, but has satisfied the requirements for the class 
project. I may continue development at some point, but as of now the game stands as an 
example of my first from scratch HTML5 Canvas game. It has served it's purpose for me 
educationally.*
